## EPIC Experience

### Pi's and Python
* This course covers the structure and fundamentals of the Linux operating system and terminal. It includes the file system, file processing, various utility programs, shell, and text processing. Basic computer hardware and GPIO components will be covered via System on a Chip (SOC) systems such as Raspberry Pi’s. Students will code using BASH and Python (or an alternative language) to create Internet of Things (IoT) devices.


### Workforce Readiness
- Over the course of the class I have become a better programmer, I did not learn any new big topic, however I now write cleaner and better code, can deal with bugs better and problem solve faster. Overall my code is a higher standard than at the beginning


### Professional Experiences
- Community service - Dumb Friends League — 20 hours
- Community service - Malley Senior Center  — 20 hours
- Work Tour of System 76

## Projects: 

[AI Image Detection Model using OpenCV and ImageAI](https://github.com/cmjspacegeek/Final-Project)

- This project represents a solo exploration into the dynamic intersection of computer science artificial intelligence and image processing. The focus lies on practical applications of image detection showcasing the potential of AI in visual recognition tasks through the integration of OpenCV and ImageAI.

- The skills I acquired was basic AI model knowledge and how to implement models. I also have more knowledge on GUIs and user-windows, along with more learning on GitHub
